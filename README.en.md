# Geofications - geo-notifications
Geofications is an Android app that allows you to create reminders and notify you based on time and location.

This is a convenient and simple application that will help you not to forget about important things. You can create reminders by time or location,
and also customize them at your discretion. For example, you can set a reminder to buy bread and the app will notify you when you are near the bakery, 
or to call a friend when at certain time.  
Geofications is a great assistant for those who want to be productive and not miss anything important in their lives!
